Uses JavaScript to play rock-scissors-paper with your computer

I'm a coding newbie and this is my first program using JavaScript (other than 'hello world'). I got the original code from codecademy's JS course (http://www.codecademy.com/)It was fun to make and I'm really starting to fall in love with JS, it's so much fun!

The game isn't very fancy or useful, but I think it would be fun to develop it further once I learn more and create some interesting functions.
